  The PC Assemble Lab provided me with a valuable hands-on experience in assembling PC components, offering a practical understanding of various elements involved in the process. Throughout this lab session, I gained insights into PC components that were previously unfamiliar to me, including RAM, CPU, Motherboard, IC, Network Cards, and more.

  What stood out during the experience was the approachability and friendliness of the staff. They were readily available to provide assistance and offered hands-on guidance whenever there was a need for clarification. Their willingness to guide us through the process made the learning experience more engaging and enjoyable.

Overall, the PC Assemble Lab not only enhanced my practical knowledge of PC components but also highlighted the importance of a supportive learning environment. The approachable of the staff contributed significantly to the positive learning atmosphere, making the entire experience both educational and enjoyable. My group members and I were the fastest to assemble the PC, and we get a reward from our lecturer!!!
